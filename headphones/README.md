# Web Page Implementation from Scratch

This project is a fully functional and responsive web page built entirely **from scratch** using only **HTML** and **CSS**. The goal is to replicate a provided design with high visual fidelity while applying best practices in structure, styling, and accessibility — all without the use of external frameworks or JavaScript.

- Implement **responsive design** and **accessibility**
